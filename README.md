# COMMON-C (COMM-C)

## Overview

*COMMON-C* is a collection of Post-FOSS C libraries providing foundational low-level tools for software and game development. The project maintains strict **C89** compliance for maximum compatibility.

*COMMON-C* operates as a federated collection of open source functions - both ported from existing projects and newly developed - reorganized into a unified framework. While the code is aggregated in one accessible location for convenience, the project maintains no central authority over its use, modification, or redistribution."

## Project Scope

COMMON-C encompasses (at present time):

**Core Systems**
- Error handling and memory management
- String manipulation and time utilities
- Platform abstraction layers

**Data Structures**
- Dynamic arrays, linked lists, queues, stacks
- Hash tables and tree implementations
- Graph structures and specialized containers

**Mathematics**
- Vector and matrix operations
- Trigonometric functions
- Random number generation

**File & Network I/O**
- Binary file operations
- Directory management
- Cross-platform TCP/UDP socket abstractions

**Development Tools**
- Command-line argument parsing
- Configuration file handling
- Logging and debugging utilities

**Media Abstractions**
- 2D graphics primitives for bitmaps and sprites
- PCM audio playback and mixing concepts
- Input handling for keyboard and mouse

## Distribution

This project is released under multiple licenses. Users may choose to operate under any or all of the following:

- Anti-Capitalist Software License (v1.4)
- Fuck Around and Find Out License (v0.1)  
- Hippocratic License (v3.0)

Full license texts are available in LICENSE.txt.

## Development

COMMON-C is maintained by members of **Elastic Softworks**.

All libraries adhere to:
- C89/ANSI C standard compliance
- C-FORM code formatting rules
- Zero external dependencies
- Cross-platform compatibility focus

## Usage

Libraries can be integrated individually or as a complete suite. Each component maintains its own documentation and examples within its respective directory.

The modular design allows developers to include only needed functionality without carrying unnecessary overhead.

## Contributing

Contributions follow horizontal collaboration principles. Submit patches, improvements, or new libraries through available federation channels. All contributions must maintain C89 compliance and follow project formatting standards.
