            --- GRAPH MODULE ---

    this module provides graph data structure implementations
    supporting both directed and undirected graphs with two
    internal representation methods:

    1. adjacency list - efficient for sparse graphs
       - space: O(V + E) where V=vertices, E=edges  
       - edge queries: O(degree of vertex)
       - ideal for most real-world graphs

    2. adjacency matrix - efficient for dense graphs
       - space: O(VÂ²) regardless of edge count
       - edge queries: O(1) constant time
       - ideal when edge density is high

    vertices are identified by integer indices from 0 to (V-1).
    edges can have optional weights for shortest-path algorithms.
    both weighted and unweighted graph variants are supported.
