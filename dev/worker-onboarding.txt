WITH REGARDS TO:

FORMATTING:

    - Refer to dev/cform.c and dev/cform.asm and the current codebase for how to format your code.

TECHNICAL:

    - IF YOU ARE NEW: Make sure to examine THE WHOLE CODEBASE before writing anything.

    - Maintain STRICT C89 compliance.
 
    - If C89 does not allow for a certain function, and all other avenues fail,
      refer to ASM and make a cross-compiled solution to have C/ASM work in tandem to
      realize the function. 

    - Do not write any functions that are already covered in the C Standard Library

COMMENTARY:

    - Ensure all functionality and systemic movements are well documented and thoroughly
      explained. Make sure that all educational language assumes the user is new to programming,
      but do not condescend: Opt to thoroughly explain all systems as they are, mathematical
      operations.
    - Do not change formatting of original comments if appending or rewriting comments.

OUTPUT:

    - All echo calls and print statements should read and be formatted like the following:

        "OUTPUT: BUILDING OUTPUT..."
        "OUTPUT: SUCCESSFUL OUTPUT...!"
        "OUTPUT" FAILED OUTPUT...!

Thank you, and good luck.
