            --- OVERHAUL STRATEGY ---

    this document outlines the complete strategy for transforming
    COMMON-C from its current scaffold state into a production-ready,
    comprehensive C89 library that rivals modern frameworks while
    maintaining educational clarity and zero external dependencies.

    the approach is methodical: stabilize, expand, polish, optimize.

	==================================
           --- CURRENT STATE ---
	==================================

    ASSETS:

    CRITICAL GAPS:
    - Zero testing infrastructure (test/ directory empty)
    - No examples or tutorials (examples/ directory empty)
    - Incomplete implementations in several modules
    - Missing build system for cross-platform compilation
    - No validation of C89 compliance across codebase
