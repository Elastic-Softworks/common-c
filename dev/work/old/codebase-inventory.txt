	==================================
        --- CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED ---
	==================================
*/

/*

         ISSUE 1: MISSING PARTICLES IMPLEMENTATION
	       ---
	       PROBLEM: particles.h exists with comprehensive API but
	       no corresponding particles.c implementation
	       
	       IMPACT: High - particle system is mentioned in README
	       as a core media abstraction feature
	       
	       REQUIRED ACTION: Create complete particles.c implementation
	       following particles.h interface

         ISSUE 2: ORPHANED INPUT SOURCE FILE
	       ---
	       PROBLEM: input.c exists but no corresponding input.h header
	       
	       IMPACT: Medium - input handling is needed but API is undefined
	       
	       REQUIRED ACTION: Either create input.h header or remove
	       input.c if functionality is covered elsewhere

         ISSUE 3: BUILD SYSTEM COMPLETELY MISSING
	       ---
	       PROBLEM: No Makefile, build scripts, or compilation instructions
	       
	       IMPACT: Critical - cannot test or validate any code
	       
	       REQUIRED ACTION: Create comprehensive build system

         ISSUE 4: COMPILED ARTIFACT IN SOURCE TREE
	       ---
	       PROBLEM: hash_table.o object file committed to repository
	       
	       IMPACT: Low - just cleanup needed
	       
	       REQUIRED ACTION: Remove hash_table.o and add to .gitignore

         ISSUE 5: NO TESTING INFRASTRUCTURE
	       ---
	       PROBLEM: test/ directory is empty, no unit tests exist
	       
	       IMPACT: Critical - cannot validate functionality
	       
	       REQUIRED ACTION: Create complete test framework

/* 
	==================================
        --- COMPILATION READINESS ASSESSMENT ---
	==================================
*/

/*
    C89 COMPLIANCE STATUS: Unknown (requires compilation testing)
    
    DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS:
    - Most modules use only standard C library functions
    - Platform-specific code properly conditionally compiled
    - Cross-platform abstractions present for Windows/Unix
    
    POTENTIAL COMPILATION ISSUES:
    - input.c includes non-existent "commc/input.h"
    - particles.h references may cause link errors if used
    - No validation of header guard consistency
    - Unknown compiler warning levels
    
    REQUIRED BEFORE COMPILATION TESTING:
    1. Create input.h or fix input.c
    2. Create particles.c or mark particles.h as TODO
    3. Create basic Makefile
    4. Test with GCC, Clang, MSVC where available
*/

/* 
	==================================
        --- RECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE ACTIONS ---
	==================================
*/

/*
    PHASE I.A COMPLETION TASKS (Priority Order):
    
    1. Create input.h header for existing input.c
    2. Create particles.c implementation 
    3. Remove hash_table.o artifact
    4. Create basic Makefile for compilation testing
    5. Test compilation with strict C89 flags
    6. Fix any compilation errors discovered
    7. Validate all header guards follow consistent naming
    8. Check for any missing #include statements
    9. Verify all function prototypes match implementations
    10. Document any incomplete function implementations
*/

/* 
	==================================
        --- FUNCTION COMPLETENESS STATUS ---
	==================================
*/

/*
    Based on header examination, most modules appear to have
    substantial implementations. However, without compilation
    testing, the following cannot be confirmed:
    
    - Whether all declared functions are implemented
    - Whether implementations match header prototypes exactly
    - Whether any functions are placeholder/stub implementations
    - Whether error handling is consistently implemented
    - Whether memory management follows declared patterns
    
    NEXT STEP: Create build system and attempt compilation
    to identify any missing function implementations or
    prototype mismatches.
