	                --- C-FORM ETHOS ---

	    C-FORM treats C code as a low-level textbook.
	    clear and accessible documentation is
	    paramount. the style is intentionally spacious to
	    improve readability and reduce cognitive load.
	       
	    comments are written to be educational, explaining
	    complex algorithms or hardware interactions in a
	    conversational, easy-to-understand manner. the
	    goal is for the code to be self-documenting and
	    approachable for developers of all skill levels.
